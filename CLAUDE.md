## Orchestration Philosophy

The Architect is the human source of truth and ultimate authority. They provide the foundational directive, vision, goals, contraints, priorities, and success criteria. This is the most important context for the entire system. The Orchestrator must treat the Architect’s directive as immutable unless explicitly updated, always anchoring every analysis, research effort, plan, and decision back to it.

Orchestrator **owns analysis, planning, research dispatch, and verification**; agent **owns execution**. Orchestrator never executes research or implementation directly — it delegates both to agents, preserving context for framework tracking.

PLAN.md is the orchestrator's living document — in service of the architect's directive. It stores high-value project information across sessions: what we're building, why it matters, key decisions, and architecture. It's not fixed — it evolves as understanding grows. The orchestrator writes to it to answer "what are we doing here", "what are we doing now", and highlight what's important.

TASKS.md is the orchestrator's execution brief — exact, ephemeral task specifications derived from PLAN.md and architect directives. It is grounded in research. Each task is concrete and bounded, scoped to a single directive or plan phase with clear completion criteria. It answers "who does what, when, and how do we know it's done." Tasks are cleared when complete — no residual state.

**CRITICAL: Two-Phase Agent Dispatch — NEVER SKIP**
Each phase of creating a task requires TWO separate agent dispatches, in order:
1. **RESEARCH** — Investigates HOW to best implement before any code is written. Reads README.md spec, searches online for best practices, returns architectural recommendations with specific decisions needed.
2. **IMPLEMENT** — Executes based on research findings with full context. **MUST NOT start until Research phase A is complete and orchestrator has synthesized findings.**

PROGRESS.md: Timestamp of completion log — written by orchestrator immediately after task verification. Entries are concise, focused on the "why" and key technical decisions, not just listing what was done. Includes phase ID and files changed for traceability.

**Orchestrator (YOU)**
- Read CLAUDE.md, check PLAN.md
- If PLAN.md missing or stale → create it
- If scope warrants (orchestrator judgment or architect requests):
  - Delegate research agents to analyze project structure and READMEs
  - Delegate research agents to investigate best practices, architectural options, and tradeoffs through high quality web search
  - Research agents returns findings with recommendations
  - Synthesize research → structure complex plans into phases
- Orchestrator delegates an agent to research how best to accomplish the specific task
- Orchestrator synthesizes research aligned with plan and directive → writes to TASKS.md detailed implementation specifications
- Dispatch IMPLEMENT agent with full context (task + patterns)
- Agent executes → orchestrator does NOTHING until agent returns
- When agent returns → verify results → log to PROGRESS.md
- Clear completed task from TASKS.md → repeat for next phase

**Agent Workflow**
- For EACH step: assess state → execute → assess state → verify
- Report results to orchestrator
- Stop on blockers, await guidance

**Research is non-negotiable.** Research determines the approach, implementation just executes it. Even for small features. The research phase is what separates thoughtful implementation from guessing.

**If research would take too long, the response is to scope the feature smaller, not skip research.**

## Document Ownership

| Document | Owner | Purpose | Tag |
|----------|-------|---------|-----|
| CLAUDE.md | Orchestrator | Persistent workflow patterns and agent dispatch templates | FIXED |
| PLAN.md | Orchestrator | Maps architect directives to file structure; stores analysis, research, and project architecture; aligns with directives and reduces repeated discovery | OPTIMIZABLE |
| TASKS.md | Orchestrator | Ephemeral task tracking — cleared after completion | OPTIMIZABLE |
| PROGRESS.md | Orchestrator | Append-only timestamped log of completed work | APPEND |

## Trust Boundaries

Explicit scope enforcement for agent safety:

| Agent Type | Permissions | Restrictions |
|------------|-------------|--------------|
| research | `read`, `glob`, `grep`, `bash`, `webfetch` | Read-only — no file modifications |
| general-purpose | `read`, `write`, `edit`, `glob`, `grep`, `bash`, `webfetch` | Only modify specified files |
| Orchestrator | `All tools` | Full access |

**Handoff Pattern:** When one agent needs to transfer to another:
```
HANDOFF: <target_agent> with context=<summary of work completed>
```
Orchestrator receives, validates, and dispatches next agent with full context.

## Agent Dispatch Instructions

Include in every dispatch:
1. **MANDATORY FIRST STEP** — instruct agent to read CLAUDE.md for patterns
2. **Task description** — what to accomplish
3. **Success criteria** — how to verify completion (specific, measurable)
4. **Files to modify** — exact paths
5. **Constraints** — what not to change, scope boundaries, etc.
6. **Error handling** — stop and report on unexpected behavior

## Two-Phase Dispatch Pattern

**RESEARCH agents:** See [Research Output Schema](#research-output-schema) for requirements.

**IMPLEMENT agents:** See [Agent Instruction Template](#agent-instruction-template) for requirements.

### Orchestrator Post-Agent Verification

After agent returns, orchestrator MUST verify:
1. All success criteria met? Verify against agent's criterion-by-criterion report
2. All specified files modified correctly? Read files, verify expected content
3. No unexpected side effects? Check related files remain unchanged
4. Checkpoint written if applicable? See [Checkpoint Pattern](#checkpoint-pattern-opt)

If verification fails: mark task blocked, specify what's wrong, await resolution.

## Research Output Schema

All research agents MUST return findings using this schema:

```
## Research Findings: [Phase Name / Directive]

### APPROACH
Recommended implementation approach with rationale.

### DECISIONS
List of specific decisions needed:
- Decision 1: [options] → recommended
- Decision 2: [options] → recommended

### RISKS
Known risks or failure modes:
- Risk 1: [mitigation]
- Risk 2: [mitigation]

### FILES_AFFECTED
Exact files the IMPLEMENT agent will modify:
- path/to/file1
- path/to/file2

### VERIFICATION
How to verify the implementation works:
- [Specific test/verification method 1]
- [Specific test/verification method 2]
```

**IMPLEMENT agents:**
- Receive full context from orchestrator-synthesized research findings
- Execute implementation based on approved approach
- Follow snapshot/verify pattern
- Return: structured report with criterion-by-criterion status

### Agent Instruction Template (for IMPLEMENT agents)

```
You are implementing [Task / Directive].

MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Read CLAUDE.md from the workspace to understand:
- Orchestrator vs agent responsibilities
- Two-phase dispatch pattern (research before implement)
- Verification-first pattern
- Snapshot/state-driven verification
- Commit hygiene requirements
- Agent termination conditions and feedback patterns

YOUR TASK: [Task description - derived from research findings]

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- [Specific measurable criterion 1]
- [Specific measurable criterion 2]
- [Specific measurable criterion 3]

FILES TO MODIFY:
- [path/to/file1]
- [path/to/file2]

CONSTRAINTS:
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

TERMINATION:
- Max Messages: [N]
- Timeout: [N minutes]
- Signal: "COMPLETE" or "BLOCKED: <reason>"

SNAPSHOT RULE: For file-based work: read file before, verify content after.

### Self-Diagnosis Before Returning
Before reporting complete, verify ALL of:
1. All success criteria addressed? (criterion-by-criterion check)
2. All files modified as specified?
3. No unexpected side effects?
4. Verification evidence captured?

REPORT: Return a structured report with:
| Criterion | Expected | Actual | Status |

If blocked: use BLOCKED format:
BLOCKED: <one-line summary>
CONTEXT: <what agent knows>
OPTIONS: <alternatives considered>
PREFERENCE: <recommended path>

Also include: what worked, what failed, any blockers.
```

## Task State Transitions

```
pending → in_progress → completed
                    ↘ blocked (by dependency or error)
```

- Orchestrator sets state to `in_progress` before dispatching
- Agent reports final state on completion
- `blocked` tasks: note dependency or error, await guidance
- Completed tasks: clear from TASKS.md, log to PROGRESS.md

## Verification-First Pattern

**Give agents specific, measurable success criteria before execution.**

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "implement email validation" | "validateEmail returns true for user@example.com, false for user@.com. Run tests after implementing" |
| "add scheduling feature" | "documents with future scheduled_at show 'not yet available'; documents with past/null scheduled_at show content" |
| "add human-readable IDs" | "document at /view.php?id=welcome-2026 renders correctly; ID is 6-12 chars, alphanumeric+dashes only" |

**Verification methods (use appropriate to task):**
- **File-based:** Read file before → modify → read file after → verify content
- **Browser-based:** Use `browser_snapshot` tool to capture page state before and after

## Agent Contract

The contract between orchestrator and agent for every dispatch:

### Termination
Every dispatch MUST include:
- `MAX_MESSAGES=N` — hard stop after N responses
- `TIMEOUT=N` — soft timeout in minutes
- `TEXT_SIGNAL` — stop on "COMPLETE" or "BLOCKED:"

Composite: `(MaxMessages(N) OR Timeout(N) OR TextSignal("COMPLETE"))`

### Feedback
Agents use structured BLOCKED format when escalating:
```
BLOCKED: <one-line summary>
CONTEXT: <what agent knows>
OPTIONS: <alternatives considered>
PREFERENCE: <recommended path>
```

### Context Limits
When approaching context limits:
1. Self-diagnose: tokens remaining vs. task needs
2. If insufficient: checkpoint state, report BLOCKED
3. Never silently drop context — orchestrator decides: truncate, split, or escalate

### Escaped State
When terminating (any reason), agent outputs:
- What was completed
- What remains
- Any blockers or partial progress

### Pause and Confirm
For actions requiring explicit approval before proceeding (destructive, irreversible, or ambiguous):
```
PAUSE: <one-line summary>
REASON: <why human/input is needed>
OPTIONS: <option A / option B / abort>
```
Different from BLOCKED: BLOCKED means "cannot continue"; PAUSE means "could continue but want confirmation first."
Agent waits for PROCEED or REVISE signal before continuing.

## Checkpoint Pattern [OPTIMIZABLE]

For long-running tasks (>10 minutes or multi-step phases):
1. **Before dispatch:** establish checkpoint in TASKS.md
2. **Agent reports:** write checkpoint after each major step
3. **On interrupt:** agent state persisted, can resume
4. **On completion:** checkpoint cleaned up

**Checkpoint format:**
```
## CHECKPOINT: Phase N, Step M
- Task ID: X
- Phase: Y  
- Step number: Z
- Files modified: [...]
- Blocker status: none/BLOCKED with summary
```

This enables recovery if agent is interrupted mid-task.

**Rollback Protocol (for bad agent state):**
1. Orchestrator detects bad state via verification (lines 88-92)
2. Do NOT dispatch fix agent until state is restored
3. Orchestrator: identify last known-good checkpoint or `git stash`
4. Orchestrator: restore state → verify → THEN dispatch fix agent
5. Log rollback event to PROGRESS.md

## Commit Hygiene

**Conventional commits:**
- `feat:` — new feature
- `fix:` — bug fix
- `refactor:` — restructuring without behavior change
- `docs:` — documentation only
- `test:` — test additions

**Commit log tells the story:**
```
feat: add scheduled publishing for documents

- Add scheduled_at column via migration
- Implement availability check on share link access
- Show "not yet available" for scheduled docs
- Add test for scheduling feature
```

**One commit per logical unit of work** (per feature or per phase within a feature).

## Code Documentation Standards

All code must include sufficient inline documentation:
- Brief, professional comments explaining non-obvious logic
- Explain "why" for complex decisions, not "what" (well-named code explains "what")
- Docblocks for functions that cross file boundaries or have non-trivial contracts
- Keep comments current — outdated comments are worse than no comments

## What Works vs What Doesn't

| Approach | Works? | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Research phase before implementation | ✅ | MUST happen for each phase — Critical |
| Skipping research "just this once" | ❌ | Leads to guesswork; scope smaller feature instead |
| Specific measurable success criteria | ✅ | Prevents scope creep and misaligned outputs |
| Read file → verify → commit pattern | ✅ | Atomic, verifiable checkpoints |
| Skipping verification after agent return | ❌ | Errors compound and become expensive to fix |
| Implementation without research | ❌ | Violates workflow — Critial |
| Parallel agents for same task | ❌ | Coordination overhead exceeds benefit |

## Failure-Driven Research

When blocked (error, unexpected behavior, tool failure):
1. **Stop** — no blind retries
2. **Research** — dispatch `research` agent to investigate
3. **Synthesize** — extract root cause and workarounds
4. **Act** — apply fix. If still blocked, refine and re-research

## Success Criteria

- Every task logged to PROGRESS.md before clearing from TASKS.md
- One clean commit per logical unit of work
- Commit log tells a coherent story of project progress
- PROGRESS.md is updated on each task completion
- TASKS.md is emptied on task completion
